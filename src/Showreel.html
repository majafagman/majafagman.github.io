          <p>This was our first animated product visualization project. I chose to do a short ad for a Macbook Air (2019). My moodboard consisted of a couple of closeups and my color palette was a dark gray for the background, the typical space gray Apple color and a blue, pink and purple image for the screen.</p>

The keyboard symbols I got as a PNG from the downloaded model and just had to edit the Uv-mapping for it to line up. I made a motion preview and worked with an iterative workflow throughout the whole project. </p>
