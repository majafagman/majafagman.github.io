          <h1>Technical vizualisation</h1>
          <p>This school assignment we made a technical visualization of a product. I chose to do Bang & Olufsens headphones.
            The first thing I made was a moodboard and storyboard and settled for the beige color palette and slow camera motions to match their previous ads. Along the whole project I made some previews and the second video is a motion preview I made in the beginning.</p>

            <p>The model I found on Blender Kit and only had to make a few adjustments. I only modeled two cables and made the fabric in Substance Sampler. The leather material I took from Blender Kit and made the other materials in Blender and only had to make a few adjustments to the Uv-mapping. The metal material I added anisotropy to get the streaks. 
                The inside of the model was empty so I assembled it from a Google Home mini and Airpods Max models. But the Airpods Max I had a hard time with its smooth edges so I added a bevel node in the shader editor.</p>
