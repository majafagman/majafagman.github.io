          <h1>Internship at Lynk & co</h1>
          <p>My internship at Lynk & co - technical training a had the opportunity to work on both 3d and 2d - animations and stills. I learned a lot from my coworkers that helped improve my modelling skills in 3d, 2d animation in After effects and over all design mindset when working closely with UI/UX designers and developers.</p>

            <p>One of my projects was to create a few illustration assets and then rig the characters and animate them in After Effects. I had a bit of a hard time in the beginning with understanding how the rigging worked and how to create a realistic looking animation. But after the advice to film my self and use that as reference from my coworker it was much easier.</p>

          <p>Another project I worked with was to create 3d animation that was used as gifs in a quiz. I made two quizzes where I created an idea and then modeled the assets in blender and textured them and then animated and rendered to after that do post and make them into gift in After Effects. The first one I made was fr the new Lynk & co car - 08. I Created small island with different types of houses to show the different climates the car is adapted to. I rigged the car and animated it to follow the road. When you have finished and answered right the car drives to the next island where the lock unlocks and the grey fades away to reveal the colors.</p>

            <p>The other animation for the second quiz was boxes on a shelf that I modeled and textured. The boxes opens when you have answered right and when the quiz is finished the spare parts (2d illustrations) fly from the boxes into a shopping cart.</p>

            <p>The other projects that I worked on the side was to create 3d assets for a car workshop. I found references, models, textured and also imported them to an Unreal Engine file to light and create the scene. This was a “nice to have” type of projects so I didn’t have the opportunity to finish it but this was some of the assets I made.</p>

            <p>Over all my time at Lynk & co was a good learning experience and I enjoyed to work with both 2d and 3d. I got to work with a lot of different projects and learned a lot about the design process and how to work with a team. I also got to learn a lot about the technical side of 3d and how to create assets that are easy to use in a production pipeline.I want to special thank you to, Mattias Bengtsson, Arash Seyedi, Josefin Schönqvist, Josef Gabrielsson, Wendy Wang-Lindblom, Rajendran Pushpamalar.
