          <h1>Internship at Filmic Art</h1>
          <p>Durring my internship at Filmic Art I got the opportunity to work on a project for Gröna Lund and their new mascots Gnuttarna. This pressphoto for the top of their website I got to do the final poses and add the assets such as the hearts and carrot-hotdog. I also got to do a bit of post in Photoshop. I did this with the help from my coworkers and feedback from the client at Gröna Lund.</p>

            <p>The next thing I did for Gröna Lund on another project, was that I modelled and tweaked some food assets for the main ad that’s releasing in April. One of the Gnutts is called Hunger-Gnutten and eats a lot of food. I modelled and texturated the pizza, the ice cream I textureated in substance and the carrot and hotdog I sculpted a bit to fit together.</p>

          <p>Some other assets I made was for the Christmas teaser with the theme of Home Alone. I modelled and textured the hot sauce (the etiquette I made in Illustrator). The other bottles, deo, shampoo and conditioner I textured the same way with custom etiquettes. I also got to sculpt the hot sauce liquid frame by frame. It was a challenge but fun to try.</p>

            <p>Another project I made for Gröna Lund was a child book. I created some of the images from scratch. I modelled objects, posed the characters, did the lightning and rendering and a bit of post in Photoshop. This was a very fun and challenging project but I had a lot of help and guidance from my coworkers at Filmic Art.</p>

            <p>Model I downloaded from Grabcad but made a few adjustments in Fusion 360 and tessellated it. The metal material I made in Substance Designer and the rest I took from Blender Kit. The keyboard symbols I got as a PNG from the downloaded model and just had to edit the Uv-mapping for it to line up. I made a motion preview and worked with an iterative workflow throughout the whole project.</p>

            <p>Another project I got the opportunity to work on durring my internship was for Norrmejerier. I got the opportunity to create the entire background (everything that’s behind the second fence is a still image). The snow was a hard challenge to get realistic looking. And I also got to do some post in after effects. The twinkling stars, lights and the cold breath from the rooster speaking. It was a very fun project to get to work on, and to also work with direct feedback from the client Norrmejerier.

              I had an amazing internship at Filmic Art and learned a lot, met incredible people and enjoyed collaborating with everyone there.
