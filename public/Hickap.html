      <h1>Hickap Bronze glow serum (fictional ad)</h1>
      <p>In this school project we were supposed to create a short ad for a brand. The focus was light, rendering and composition. 
         I knew from the start that I wanted to do something related to a skincare brand, and found Hickap and their Bronze glow serum.

        <p>I started off with creating a moodboard with color scheme, compositions and overall look of the product (second image). The model I found on Blender Kit but did a few adjustments. The scene I built myself and simulated the liquid. It was a challenge to make the liquid decent looking but in the end I achieved a goodenough result and settled for it. I did post (colorgrading, etc.) in Nuke and in After effects I edited and added music and text elements.</p>
