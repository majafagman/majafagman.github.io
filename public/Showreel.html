          <p>This was one of the first projects I created in Houdini with a focus on procedural design. I developed a procedural flower that offers intuitive control over its shape, size, and number of petals. The system allows for rapid adjustments to petal form, arrangement, and curvature, enabling a wide range of unique variations. By fine-tuning both the overall structure and individual petal characteristics, the setup provides a highly adaptable and dynamic design suited to various artistic styles and applications.

            <p>This was one of my first projects in Unreal Engine. At the beginning I had meny different ideas and hd a hard time to narrow it down to one but when I found a video in Pinterest with light that “struck” down on different places in a forest according to the melody of the sone I knew I wanted to do something similar. I downloaded the Volkswagen model and tweaked it a bit. The other assets are from Quixel Bridge. I built the forest around the car and animated it in Unreal I then rendered it with Lumen. I made the finishing touches in After Effects.</p>

            <p>When I created this piece, I dove into the basics of Houdini, exploring its procedural workflows and powerful toolset. I modeled every element in the scene and focused on learning how to use the scatter and animation nodes effectively. By animating the scatter system, I was able to create a dynamic effect of grass growing organically along the surface of the bottle. This has been a valuable and exciting step in my journey toward understanding Houdini’s capabilities, and it’s deepened my appreciation for procedural animation and design.</p>

            <p>This was a school project to understand how simulating liquid works and also work more with lightning and compositioning. I choose to make a waterproof speaker that I downloaded and then simulated water splashing from behind. The post I did in Photoshop and the rest I made in Blender.</p>

            <p>I took a photo of a shelf in my kitchen and used it as a background to integrate a 3D model of a Rituals light. I modeled and textured the light in Blender, and used F-Spy to match the camera perspective. The final render was composited into the photo using Photoshop to achieve a realistic result.            </p>

            <p>I created this project during upper secondary school as part of a course where I learned the fundamentals of illustration, layout, typography, and design. The assignment was to rebrand a fictional company called Amelia's Gass. I designed the logo from scratch, selected the color palette, and chose the fonts and accompanying pattern. As part of the branding, I created a poster mockup along with two product mockups. This was both a fun and challenging project that helped me develop my design thinking and visual communication skills.
